        <p>The Computer Engineering program has adopted the following educational objectives.</p>
        <p>Three to five years after graduation, the Computer Engineering alumni shall:</p>
        <br />
        <p>• have advanced their practice or achievement in the field of Computer Engineering and/or other endeavors or advocacies supported by their acquired computer engineering education;</p>
        <p>• strive to be globally competitive through</p>
        <p>1. living by the TIP mission values, pursuing continuing education, and practicing continuous quality improvement in their personal lives;</p>
        <p>2. continuously scanning, adopting, and building on the best practices in their field.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2><strong>STUDENT OUTCOMES</strong></h2>
        <br />
        <p>By the time of graduation, students will be able to:</p>
        <p>a. apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering to solve complex engineering problems;</p>
        <p>b. identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems;</p>
        <p>c. solve complex engineering problems by designing systems, components, or processes to meet specifications within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, cultural, social, societal, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability in accordance with standards;</p>
        <p>d. design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze, and interpret data, and synthesize information to provide valid conclusions for investigating complex problems;</p>
        <p>e. use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice in complex engineering activities;</p>
        <p>f. apply knowledge of contemporary issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to professional engineering practice;</p>
        <p>g. understand the impact of professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts and demonstrate knowledge of and need for sustainable development;</p>
        <p>h. apply principles of ethics and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities;</p>
